The pilot and passenger were not injured. The airplane was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 91 personal flight.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot reported that the accident occurred while landing the tailwheel-equipped airplane on runway 17. The reported surface wind was from the west-southwest at 6-7 knots. The pilot reported that the airplane drifted right of the runway centerline during landing rollout, but his left rudder input did not correct for the right drift and the airplane departed off the right side of the runway. The airplane\u2019s main landing gear sunk into soft turf which resulted in the airplane to nose over. The pilot and his passenger egressed from the airplane without injury. The airplane sustained substantial damage to the vertical stabilizer, rudder, and both wings.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA postaccident examination of the airplane\u2019s rudder control system revealed that the left rudder cable was fractured. The fractured rudder cable and an associated pulley were removed from the airplane and shipped to the National Transportation Safety Board\u2019s materials laboratory for additional examination and testing.",

    "prelimNarrative": "On April 29, 2025, at 1534 Pacific daylight time, a Champion 7ECA, N6310N, was destroyed when it was involved in an accident near Cottonwood, California. The flight instructor and pilot receiving instruction were fatally injured. The airplane was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 instructional flight.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA witness, who was friend of both pilots, and located at the Red Bluff Municipal Airport (RBL), Red Bluff, California, reported that about 30 minutes prior to the accident, he observed the pilots at the airport and approached them for general conversation. He observed the flight instructor seated in the front and the rear seated pilot was undergoing instruction for his flight instructor certificate. According to the witness, the flight instructor was acting as a student pilot, and rear-seated pilot was acting as the flight instructor in preparation for an upcoming a check ride.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFirst responders located near the accident site reported that they observed black smoke rising toward the sky. When they arrived at the accident site location, they saw the airplane adjacent to a residence as well as a person (later identified as an occupant of the airplane), walking around the area. They began to extinguish the fire and render aide to the patient. The first responders stated that the patient was alert and able to tell them that he self-extricated from the airplane and someone else, the flight instructor, was still in the airplane. The patient told the first responders that the \u201cman who was in the plane was flying at the time of the accident and had overshot the runway they were attempting to land on.\u201d He added that the pilot flying \u201cpowered up and then lost control of the [air]plane.\u201d &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the accident site revealed that the airplane impacted several trees and came to rest at a base of a tree about 585 ft south of the departure end of runway 16 at the Flying N Ranch Airport (CA04), Cottonwood, California. The first identified point of contact (FIPC) was a downed fence post located about 40 ft south of the departure end of the runway, aligned on an extended centerline. The downed fence post was about 5 ft in height and was separated at the base. The downed fence post exhibited a black transfer mark near the top of the post. A tree, about 40 ft tall, was about 380 ft south of the FIPC, had damaged limbs near the top of the tree. The debris path was oriented along a heading of about 355\u00b0 magnetic and about 100 ft in length from the FIPC to the main wreckage. The fuselage came to rest on its left side in an approximate 10\u00b0 nose low attitude, on a heading of about 310\u00b0 magnetic, at an elevation of 538 ft mean sea level (msl). The right wing and left main landing gear were separated from the fuselage and located about 5 to 10 north of the main wreckage. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe wreckage was recovered to a secure location for further examination.",

An emergency locator transmitter was activated shortly after.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSearch and rescue assets discovered one of the two pontoons, a plastic container containing a backpack, a seat cushion, and an empty life raft floating on the ocean surface in the vicinity where the airplane went missing. An oil slick was also observed on the water next to the pontoon. The search continued through the following day. The airplane and pilot have not been located. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nADS-B information showed the airplane took off and climbed to approximately 6,000 ft msl and proceeded on an easterly heading. About 21 minutes into the flight, the pilot reported picking up ice and requested a higher altitude. He was cleared and climbed to 7,000 ft. About 35 minutes into the flight, the airplane made a slight right turn and proceeded east-southeast. About 1 hour and 6 minutes into the flight, the airplane began a 2,000 ft/min. descent to the ocean surface. Just before reaching the surface, the airplane made a 180o turn toward the west. ADS-B data ended 1 hour and 10 minutes after takeoff.",

Shortly after, the left engine sustained a total loss of power. The pilot performed a forced landing to a flat corn field, located about 19.5 miles southeast of the destination airport. The two controllable pitch propellers were not feathered, and the main landing gear was not extended prior to landing in the field. The airplane came to rest upright in the field. The three occupants were able to egress from the airplane without further incident.&#x0D;\nThe airplane sustained substantial damage to the fuselage and the left wing, and no evidence of a reported fire was noted with the right engine. During the recovery operation, the airframe fuel system was found intact and there were no visible signs of fuel leakage on the airframe. The airframe can contain up to 384 gallons of usable fuel. For the left side of the airplane, about 1 pint of fuel was recovered from the main fuel tank and about 9 gallons of fuel were recovered from the nacelle fuel tank. For the right side of the airplane, about 2 pints of fuel were recovered from the main fuel tank and no fuel was recovered from the nacelle fuel tank. The pilot did not provide any accident flight fuel planning calculation documents. The airplane was not equipped with a low fuel warning light system, nor was it required to be.",

    "prelimNarrative": "On April 28, 2025, about 1355 Alaska daylight time, a Cessna T207 airplane, N91025, was substantially damaged when it was involved in an accident near Nanwalek, Alaska. The pilot and one passenger were fatally injured. One passenger was seriously injured. The airplane was operated as flight number 213, a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 135 scheduled commuter air carrier flight.&#x0D;\nAccording to the operator, Smokey Bay Air, the pilot and two passengers departed the Homer Airport, Homer, Alaska, en route to the Nanwalek Airport, Nanwalek with 40 gallons of aviation fuel on board, 271 lbs of passenger baggage, and 257 lbs U.S. mail on board. &#x0D;\nArchived Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) data shows the airplane departing Homer, crossing Kachemak Bay and following the coastline before approaching Runway 19 in Nanwalek from the North. &#x0D;\nThe ADS-B track data then shows that, as the airplane approached Nanwalek Airport from the north, it momentarily sidestepped to the right of the runway centerline, which was followed by a left turn once it was parallel with the approach end of Runway 19. The airplane was about 100 ft above ground level (AGL) at the final ADS-B captured datapoint (See figure 1).&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 1 \u2013 Area map with ADS-B track and airport information &#x0D;\nMultiple witnesses, located on the ground in the vicinity of the airport, reported seeing the airplane approaching Runway 19 for landing, from over the village. The witnesses then stated that the airplane increased throttle and entered a steep left bank near the North end of Nanwalek Airport before losing control and spiraling down to the ground. Some witnesses reported seeing a dog on the runway when the accident airplane was on final approach.&#x0D;\nA pilot, in a second Smokey Bay Airplane a few miles in trail of the accident airplane also inbound to Nanwalek Airport, recalled hearing the accident pilot state, over the radio, \u201cI\u2019m going around, there\u2019s something on the runway,\u201d just before the accident.&#x0D;\nThe surviving passenger was later interviewed at a hospital in Anchorage, Alaska. He reported approaching Nanwalek Airport from the village side and recalled that the airplane was offset to the right of runway centerline on final approach. He then stated that the airplane entered a sharp, steeper than normal, left banking turn before losing control and rapidly spiraling down to the surface (See figure 2).  &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 2 \u2013 Image of accident airplane after recovery from beach (NTSB Photo)&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe airplane came to rest on the beach about 350 ft northwest of the approach end of Runway 19. First responders subsequently pulled the airplane wreckage to higher ground to keep the airplane from becoming submerged as the tide began to rise.   &#x0D;\nThe left wing was separated from the fuselage, held only by the control cables, and rotated forward of the main wreckage. The right wing exhibited spanwise deformation to the outboard section, beyond the lift strut, consistent with impact damage. Both the aft section of the fuselage, forward of the empennage, and the nose section of the fuselage, forward of the cockpit, exhibited damage consistent with rotational forces on impact.&#x0D;\nDuring the onsite investigation, no preimpact anomalies were visually observed with the flight control system. The flap selector was found in the full down position. The three propeller blades exhibited rotational signatures.&#x0D;\nThe wreckage has been recovered to a secure facility for further examination.",

He performed a no-flap, straight in approach to runway 35, and the airplane touched down just before the 1,000 ft runway marker. After touchdown the airplane veered to the right of the runway, and he attempted to correct back to the runway with brake and left rudder inputs. As the airplane continued off runway heading, the pilot initiated a go-around and was about 5 to 10 ft above ground level when the stall warning horn annunciated. The pilot reduced back pressure, and the airplane touched back down on the runway. The pilot stated that he had insufficient braking after touchdown and the airplane exited the runway surface and struck an agricultural ditch. The airplane sustained substantial damage to the fuselage and right wing.&#x0D;\nThe pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane that would have precluded normal operation.",

    "prelimNarrative": "On April 26, 2025, about 1147 central daylight time, a Mooney M20TN, N242RE, was substantially damaged when it was involved in an accident near Sparta, Tennessee. The private pilot and two passengers were fatally injured. The airplane was operated as a Title 14?Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 personal flight.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nEarlier that day the pilot flew from the Upper Cumberland Regional Airport (SRB), Sparta, Tennessee, to Shelby County Airport (EET), Alabaster, Alabama, where he landed, boarded 2 passengers and some cargo, then departed to return to SRB.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) preliminary air traffic control audio and Automatic Dependent Surveillance \u2013\u00a0Broadcast (ADS-B) data, after takeoff about 1039 the flight proceeded toward SRB while maintaining contact with several air traffic control facilities along the route of flight. Approaching SRB from the southwest, at 1136:55, the Sector 41 Radar Position controller of the Memphis Air Route Traffic Control Center instructed the pilot to cross the WENUB (intermediate fix/initial approach fix) at or above 4,000 ft and cleared the flight for the RNAV runway 4 approach to SRB. The flight continued direct to WENUB then turned to a northeast direction while flying toward SRB. At 1143:52, when the flight was about 6.2 nautical miles from the approach end of runway 4, the pilot cancelled his instrument flight rules clearance and informed the controller that the cloud bases were at 3,000 ft. Personnel at SRB reported hearing the pilot announce on the SRB common traffic advisory frequency that the flight was 11 miles and then 3 miles from SRB. There was no reported distress call made by the pilot.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe flight continued direct towards SRB until 1146:56, after which time a slight deviation to the right occurred. A witness who was located about .3 nautical mile west-northwest of the accident site reported there was, \u201csome kind of trouble the engine was cutting in and out like it was out of gas.\u201d She observed the airplane was in level flight then diverted her attention and then heard the sound of a crash.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nDuring the final portion of the flight the airplane flew over a field with crop and impacted into trees and a creek about 1.5 nautical miles southwest from the approach end of runway 4. Initial examination of the engine revealed evidence of internal catastrophic malfunction. The No. 3 cylinder connecting rod was fractured and not attached at either end. The No. 3 cylinder connecting rod journal did not display any evidence of lack of lubrication. The engine was retained for further examination.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA Stratus 3 receiver was located in the wreckage and retained for read-out by the NTSB Vehicle Recorders Division. Additionally, the shoulder harness airbag electronic module assembly, a portion of the pitch trim system and an annunciator panel were also retained for further examination.",

The flight instructor and commercial pilot receiving instruction were not injured. The airplane was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 instructional flight.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe flight instructor reported that the purpose of the flight was for the commercial pilot to obtain currency in tailwheel airplane takeoffs and landings. They departed with 16 gallons of fuel and remained in the airport traffic pattern at Shenandoah Valley Regional Airport (SHD), Weyers Cave, Virginia. The first takeoff and landing were uneventful. During the second approach, \u201cabeam the numbers,\u201d the commercial pilot reduced engine power, applied carburetor heat, and began a descent. When the airplane was turning from base leg to final leg, about 600 ft above ground level (agl), the instructor advised the commercial pilot to increase engine power so they would not fly below the proper glidepath. At that time, the commercial pilot advised that the engine was not responding to throttle input, and the instructor took control of the airplane. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe flight instructor lowered the nose to maintain airspeed. He then verified that the fuel, mixture, primer, switches, and carburetor heat controls were in the correct position. About 300 ft agl, the instructor noted that the airplane was too low to clear a road and guardrail just prior to the runway, so he elected to turn right and land in a field. During the landing, the airplane struck a wire fence, the right main landing gear collapsed, and the airplane came to rest on its right wing. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the wreckage by two Federal Aviation Administration inspectors revealed substantial damage to the right wing and fuselage. The inspectors also noted that adequate fuel remained onboard. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe wreckage was retained for further examination.",

    "prelimNarrative": "On  April 25, 2025, about 1814 Hawaii standard time, an Amazon Prime Air Boeing 767-319 operated by Air Transport International departed from Ontario International Airport (ONT), Ontario, California and intended to land at Lihue Airport (LIH), Lihue, Hawaii but diverted to Daniel K. Inouye International Airport (HNL), Honolulu, Hawaii due to an inoperative horizontal stabilizer and the need for a longer runway. The airplane landed at HNL without issue. There were two flight crew members on board, and the flight was conducted as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 121 cargo flight.&#x0D;\nHistory of Flight&#x0D;\nOn descent into LIH, the autopilot repeatedly disconnected. The crew ran the autopilot disconnect checklist, which did not resolve the issue. The crew started hand-flying the airplane at about 10,000\u00a0feet and reported that \u201cnoticeable down pressure on [the] yoke [was required] to keep [the] airplane descending.\u201d The crew noticed the horizontal stabilizer was inoperative at 3.4 units on the stabilizer position indicator. They tried to use the alternate electric trim switches, but the stabilizer remained stuck.&#x0D;\nThe crew leveled off the airplane at 3,000\u00a0feet. They selected flaps\u00a05 to reduce the control column force required to maintain the desired pitch. Next, they performed the stabilizer trim checklist per the quick reference handbook (QRH), but the issue persisted. The crew also performed the unscheduled stabilizer trim checklist, with no improvement. The crew reported that they did not receive a \u201cSTAB TRIM\u201d engine indicating and crew alerting system (EICAS) message or the associated cockpit warning light at any point during the flight. The crew declared an emergency and diverted to HNL, where they landed safely with flaps\u00a025 selected.&#x0D;\nHorizontal Stabilizer Trim Control System Description&#x0D;\nThe horizontal stabilizer is a moveable airfoil at the back of the airplane which trims the airplane longitudinally. Its overall function is to alter its angle of attack during flight, as necessary, to keep the airplane in a condition of maneuvering and speed stability. The stabilizer control system on the incident airplane is controlled by electrical inputs. These inputs are received by two Stabilizer Trim Control Modules (STCMs). The STCMs direct left and center hydraulic system pressure to the horizontal stabilizer trim actuator (HSTA).&#x0D;\nThe HSTA is located forward and above the stabilizer center section and is attached to bulkhead structure at the top and to stabilizer structure at the bottom (figure\u00a01). The HSTA includes two drive hydraulic motors and two hydraulically released secondary brakes. These work together to rotate the ballscrew, thereby moving the horizontal stabilizer about its center section pivot points and changing its angle of attack.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure\u00a01. HSTA location and components labeled (Source: Boeing, modified. Image copyright \u00a9 Boeing. Reproduced with permission).&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nInvestigation&#x0D;\nThe NTSB was notified of this incident on April\u00a029,\u00a02025, and it was originally graded as a class\u00a05 investigation. After initial investigation, it was upgraded to a class\u00a03 investigation on September\u00a08,\u00a02025.&#x0D;\nThe airplane had undergone scheduled maintenance about one month before the incident flight during which an overhauled HSTA was installed. At the time of the incident flight, the overhauled HSTA had been installed on the aircraft for 11\u00a0cycles and 31\u00a0flight hours. The HSTA was removed after landing and sent to the component manufacturer for examination under the direction of the NTSB.&#x0D;\nThe flight data from the incident is being reviewed, and the investigation is ongoing.",

Prior to the flight, the pilot discussed the confined area landing zone characteristics with another company pilot, and he studied satellite imagery of the confined area landing zone. The flight manifest and the flight risk assessment tool were completed and submitted to the operational control center, which then issued a flight release after approval. Prior to initiating the approach, the pilot performed a high reconnaissance to identify the confined area landing zone and the obstacles which consisted of a tree and power lines. The pilot then performed a low reconnaissance while simultaneously performing a steep approach. The helicopter landed in the vacant lot, consisting of a flat grass field, across the street from the fire department.&#x0D;\nSeveral hours later after the training was completed, the pilot performed a ground reconnaissance, noting the tree and the power lines. Ground personnel illuminated the power lines near the confined area landing zone for the night takeoff. The pilot, who was utilizing night vision goggles with the helicopter\u2019s searchlight activated, brought the helicopter to an in ground effect hover, and he balanced the torque indications for the two turboshaft engines. The pilot decided to use the power lines in front of the helicopter as a visual reference for the initial climb. During the initial climb, the helicopter inadvertently drifted rearward, and the tail rotor system impacted the tree. The helicopter rotated to the right, descended, and it came to rest partially upright. Shortly after impacting the ground, a postimpact fire initiated, and partially consumed the helicopter.&#x0D;\nThe front right seat pilot and the rear left seat (aft facing) flight nurse were able to egress on their own from the helicopter. The front left seat flight nurse required assistance from ground personnel to egress from the helicopter. The fire department was able to immediately perform fire suppression efforts on the helicopter. The helicopter sustained substantial damage to the fuselage, the main rotor system, the empennage, and the tail rotor system. The helicopter was not equipped with a crash resistant fuel system, nor was it required by regulation.",

    "prelimNarrative": "On April 24, 2025, about 1135 eastern daylight time, an MX Aircraft Tech PTY LTD MXS airplane, N530RH, was substantially damaged when it was involved in an accident at Langley Air Force Base (LFI), Hampton, Virginia. The pilot was fatally injured. The airplane was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 personal flight.&#x0D;\nThe flight originated from Smyrna Airport (MQY), Smyrna, Tennessee, and was destined for LFI, where the pilot intended to perform an aerobatic routine during an upcoming airshow.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMultiple witnesses stated that they observed the airplane on approach to land on runway 08 at LFI. The airplane made a normal approach to the runway and when it was over the end of the runway, it leveled off about 50 ft above the runway and flew straight down the runway for several hundred feet. The airplane then \u201cporpoised\u201d twice, pitched \u201cstraight up,\u201d rolled 90\u00b0 to the left and descended to ground impact. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe single-seat aerobatic airplane, serial number MXS-001, was issued a special airworthiness certificate in the experimental category for the purpose of exhibition and air racing by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on July 26, 2019. The pilot collaborated with the manufacturer to modify the airplane to his specifications, which included an access hole on the left and right elevator to insert counterweights to adjust elevator feel depending on the aerobatic routine performed. An aluminum threaded plug was used to access the counterweight hole (figure 1). &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 1. Counterweight plug as installed on the right elevator (postaccident photograph).&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe airplane came to rest on a heading of 150\u00b0 in a grass ditch about 100 ft from the left side of runway 08 and 500 ft beyond the approach threshold. All major components of the airplane were accounted for at the accident site. The left elevator counterweight plug was not installed and was located about 10 ft behind the wreckage in the grass. Dirt consistent with that found in the vicinity of the accident site was identified on the elevator, as well as in the counterbore and threaded area where the counterweight plug would have been installed. The counterweight plug threads were intact and also contained similar dirt contamination consistent with that found on the elevator. Additionally, about half of the circumference of the left elevator counterweight plug displayed gouging and there was evidence of paint transfer (figure 2). &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 2. Left elevator counterweight installation hole (left) and recovered counterweight plug (right). Note: gouging and paint transfer on counterweight plug.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe horizontal stabilizer structure adjacent to the elevator position where the counterweight plug would have been installed displayed dents and paint scrapes consistent with contact with the counterweight plug (figure 3). &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 3. Horizontal stabilizer structure adjacent to the left elevator counterweight plug. Note: dented washer and scrapes, circled in yellow.   &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe left wing remained attached to the fuselage. The left aileron was intact, though the outer section of the aileron was fractured at its hinge point. The right wing remained attached to the fuselage. The center fuel tank was breached, and both the left and right fuel tanks were empty. The empennage was intact and the left elevator was fractured off the outer hinge at the upper bracket that connected to the fuselage. The elevator trim tab was found in the full up (nose down) position. The right elevator was intact and remained attached. The rudder was intact and the bottom of the rudder was crushed. The cockpit and instrument panel displayed impact-related damage, and several instruments were dislodged and located around the cockpit. The throttle grip was fractured off the side of the cockpit. The control column was fractured off the bottom hinge point. The canopy was fractured into several pieces that were located around the main wreckage. Flight control continuity was traced from the cockpit control stick to all flight control surfaces. The right aileron torque tube was fractured consistent with impact. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe propeller hub remained attached to the engine crankshaft. Two of the three propeller blades were broken off at the hub. The remaining propeller blade exhibited minor scaring. The rear part of the oil sump/air plenum was fractured. The exhaust and intake tubes were crushed upwards. The top two engine mounts were separated from the engine case. The top sparkplugs were removed and appeared normal as compared to the Champion Aviation chart AV-27. When the engine crankshaft was rotated by hand, thumb compression was attained at all the cylinders and engine drivetrain continuity was confirmed throughout. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe airplane was equipped with an MGL Avionics primary flight display which was retained for data download. The remainder of the wreckage was also retained for further examination.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe airplane\u2019s most recent condition inspection was completed on March 3, 2025, at a total airframe time of 1,062 hours. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot held an airline transport pilot certificate with ratings for airplane single-engine land, airplane single-engine sea, airplane multiengine land, and gliders. He also held flight instructor and ground instructor certificates. The pilot reported 15,387 hours of total flight experience on his most recent application for an FAA second-class medical certificate, which was issued on March 5, 2025.",

    "prelimNarrative": "On April 23, 2025, about 1703 eastern daylight time, a Cessna 172RG, N6386V, was substantially damaged when it was involved in an accident near Louisburg, North Carolina. The commercial pilot and passenger were not injured. The airplane was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 personal flight.  &#x0D;\nThe pilot reported that he performed a preflight inspection of the airplane. During the inspection, he found water while sampling fuel from the fuel tanks. The pilot continued to sample fuel from the fuel tanks until no more water was found. He then rocked the wings to release any trapped water and sampled fuel from the fuel tanks again until there was no water found. He reported that the wing fuel tanks were about half full of fuel. &#x0D;\nThe engine start and run-up were normal, with no abnormalities noted by the pilot.  About 1702, the pilot entered the runway and applied full power for takeoff. With all engine indications normal, he released the brakes and began the takeoff roll. When the airplane reached an airspeed of 55 knots, the pilot increased the airplane\u2019s pitch attitude and began climbing out at an airspeed 70 knots. When no usable runway remained, the pilot selected the landing gear to the up position, and he reported \u201cthe moment the landing pump switched on the engine lost power.\u201d The pilot described the loss of power as a smooth reduction of power to idle, where the engine stayed. He selected the landing gear to the down position, reduced the throttle control, and attempted to land on the remaining runway and runoff area. After realizing he could not, he attempted to glide over an airport perimeter fence. During the glide, he applied full throttle, and the engine revved to about 1,900 rpm before reducing uncommanded again to idle. The landing gear impacted the perimeter fence, the horizontal stabilizer impacted a fence pole, and the airplane impacted a road near the airport perimeter, sliding off the road and into a field. The horizontal stabilizer sustained substantial damage during the accident sequence.&#x0D;\nThe wreckage was retained for further examination.",

He immediately feathered the propeller and applied power to the right engine, which was also no longer producing power, and he realized that both engines had lost power. The pilot attempted to maintain control of the airplane while searching for an adequate landing location, but ultimately landed in heavily wooded terrain. The airplane sustained substantial damage to the fuselage, empennage, horizontal stabilizer, and both wings.&#x0D;\nA postaccident examination of the airplane revealed that the left auxiliary fuel tank was about \u00be-full of fuel, while the right auxiliary tank was about \u00bd-full of fuel. Both main fuel tanks contained no fuel. After the accident, the pilot articulated that the reason for the loss of engine power was fuel starvation. Based on the (inaccurate) fuel quantity indicators in the cockpit, he believed that each main fuel tank was between \u00bc- and \u00bd-full. He did not visually look inside of the fuel tanks during the preflight inspection and that he did not get fuel before departing. The pilot also described that he should have immediately switched to auxiliary fuel tanks following the losses of engine power.",

The pilot and two passengers were not injured. The flight was operated under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 as a personal flight. &#x0D;\nAccording to the pilot, he departed Drake Field Airport (FYV) in Fayetteville, Arkansas. About 14 nm away from the airport, the alternator light came on and smoke started to come out from under the instrument panel. The pilot diverted back to FYV. About 5 nm from FVY, oil started to spray onto the windshield and fire was coming out from underneath the cowling. The engine seized, and the propeller stopped. The pilot glided the airplane back to FVY and landed; however, the landing gear collapsed upon runway contact, and the airplane slid off the runway. The fuselage and horizontal stabilizer were substantially damaged. &#x0D;\nThe airplane was retained for further examination.",

As the airplane accelerated, he utilized right rudder to maintain runway centerline. When the airplane became airborne, it drifted to the right, over the grass area adjacent to the runway. The pilot applied left aileron to counteract the right drift, and the airplane pitched nose down. As he applied back pressure on the control stick, the stall warning horn activated, and he neutralized the flight controls. The airplane subsequently yawed left, and the pilot applied right aileron and rudder control inputs to correct the yaw and continued the takeoff. Following an uneventful landing, a postflight examination of the airplane revealed both wings and the rudder had struck the ground, which resulted in substantial damage to the rudder. At the time of the accident, the pilot was departing runway 28R, and the wind was from 290\u00b0 at 7 knots. &#x0D;\nThe pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane that would have precluded normal operation.",

    "analysisNarrative": "Southwest Airlines Flight 2782, a scheduled domestic passenger flight from Dallas Love Field Airport (DAL), Dallas, Texas, to Tulsa International Airport (TUL), Tulsa, Oklahoma, encountered moderate turbulence during descent. As a result, a flight attendant sustained a serious injury.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the flight crew, all flight attendants (FAs) were briefed prior to departure that no cabin service would be conducted due to forecast turbulence. They were instructed to remain seated for the duration of the short 39-minute flight. Following passenger boarding and prior to pushback, the captain made a public address (PA) announcement advising passengers that, due to current and forecasted weather conditions, the FAs would remain seated for safety reasons and cabin service would not be provided.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe flight crew reported that before descent, at approximately FL250 (25,000 feet), the captain made a descent PA announcement advising passengers to remain seated due to expected turbulence during the descent into Tulsa.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe flight crew reported that they chimed (pressed the ATTEND call button once) the cabin between FL190 and FL180 to indicate final descent.\u00a0Per Southwest Airlines procedures, the 18,000-foot chime directs flight attendants to secure the cabin for arrival and make passengers final announcements. The policy specifies that if turbulence prevents a compliance check or walkthrough, the flight attendants are required to stop duties and secure themselves in a jumpseat. The flight crew reported the high-low chime occurred earlier than the standard FL180 due to anticipated weather and received the normal confirmation from the cabin crew.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe\u00a0flight crew\u00a0were set up for the ILS approach to runway 36R and began their descent for the approach. They inquired and received ride reports from Tulsa approach, who indicated light to moderate turbulence and heavy rain reported from a regional jet.&#x0D;\nDuring the descent into Tulsa, at approximately 15,000 feet mean sea level (MSL), the airplane encountered moderate turbulence while operating in instrument meteorological conditions (IMC). &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nDespite prior instructions from the flight crew, the FAs in the \u201cC\u201d and \u201cB\u201d position left their jumpseats during final descent. The \u201cC\u201d FA had to use the lavatory and the \u201cB\u201d FA got up to prepare the cabin for landing.  FA \u201cB\u201d stated it was an automatic response to prepare the cabin even though she remembered afterwards being briefed to remain seated.  &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFA \u201cB\u201d was standing in the aft galley and making an announcement to the passengers when she experienced two pronounced jolts of turbulence. The turbulence caused the flight attendant to become airborne and subsequently impact the cabin floor with significant force, resulting in serious spinal injuries.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe \u201cC\u201d FA notified the flight crew that the \u201cB\u201d FA was injured.  The flight crew requested medical assistance before arrival, and emergency personnel met the aircraft at the gate. The injured FA was subsequently transported to a local hospital.",

The pilot was not injured. The airplane was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 personal flight. &#x0D;\nThe pilot reported after completing a thorough preflight inspection and adding fuel to the main saddle tanks. The pilot departed runway 7R at Phoenix Deer Valley Airport, Phoenix, Arizona, with the intention of staying in the airport traffic pattern, to \u201cexercise the airplane.\u201d  During an approach for a third touch and go takeoff and landing, the pilot initiated a go-around at the direction of the air traffic control tower controller.  As he turned onto the downwind leg for runway 7R, about 1,000 ft above the ground (agl), the engine RPM surged multiple times followed by a total loss of engine power. The pilot turned the electric fuel boost pump on (both high and low speed settings) and cycled the throttle and mixture lever settings, but the engine did not restart. &#x0D;\nAbout 700 ft agl, the pilot turned towards the airport and declared an emergency, in which he was immediately cleared by a tower controller to land on runway 25R. The pilot realized that he would not be able to make it to the airport and initiated a forced landing onto a road. During the off-airport landing sequence, the pilot the pilot maneuvered from the road to avoid a vehicle, and the airplane impacted a carport roof. Subsequently the airplane came to rest nose down in a parking lot. Postaccident examination of the airplane revealed that both lower wings were substantially damaged. &#x0D;\nThe airplane was recovered to a secure location for further examination.",

    "prelimNarrative": "On April 19, 2025, at 1016 central daylight time, a Cessna 180G, N4679U, was destroyed when it was involved in an accident near Trilla, Illinois. The private pilot and three passengers were fatally injured. The airplane was operated under Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 as a personal flight.&#x0D;\nAccording to flight history data, the airplane departed its home base in Menomonie, Wisconsin, on April 16, 2025, on a visual flight rules cross-country flight to Muhlenberg County Airport (M21), Greenville, Kentucky. The pilot purchased 42 gallons of 100 low lead aviation fuel at M21 before continuing to John C. Tune Airport (JWN), Nashville, Tennessee.&#x0D;\nOn the day of the accident, the pilot flew back to M21 to retrieve a purse that a passenger inadvertently left at the airport during the previous visit. The pilot purchased an additional 12.81 gallons of aviation fuel before departing northbound. Automatic Dependent Surveillance\u2013Broadcast (ADS-B) data showed the airplane proceeding toward Mattoon, Illinois.&#x0D;\nA witness reported that he was on a roof performing repairs when he heard an airplane overhead. He described the engine sound as \u201cunusually low\u201d and similar to that of a \u201ccrop duster.\u201d The engine noise increased, as if the airplane was attempting to climb at the end of a low pass. He then heard an explosion and observed a fireball beyond the tree line. The witness further noted that it had recently stopped raining; however, it was \u201cmisting\u201d at time of the accident.&#x0D;\nSurveillance video from a location near the accident site depicted weather conditions that included overcast clouds and light rain.&#x0D;\nThe airplane was located on a county road about 8 nautical miles south of Coles County Memorial Airport (MTO), Mattoon, Illinois. An examination of the accident site revealed that the airplane struck power lines about 35 ft in height, before ground impact. The debris path extended approximately 100 ft along a 227\u00b0 magnetic heading. The wreckage was highly fragmented. All major components of the airplane were located within the debris field. Flight control continuity was confirmed to all flight control surfaces through breaks that were consistent with tension overload. The engine was found partially buried in a crater about 3 ft deep, and was heavily impact damaged. &#x0D;\nThe wreckage was recovered for further examination.&#x0D;\nThe pilot held a private pilot certificate with a rating for airplane single engine land. He did not hold an instrument rating. Initial review of the pilot\u2019s logbook revealed that he had accumulated about 300 hours of total flight experience as of October 2024.",

The pilot and two passengers were fatally injured. The flight was conducted as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 personal flight. &#x0D;\nThe flight arrived at the Fremont Municipal Airport (FET), Fremont, Nebraska, from Moundridge, Kansas, and friends had come to the airport to pick up the pilot and his wife. After arriving, the pilot and friends decided to take a quick flight, and the pilot\u2019s wife waited at the airport. The pilot\u2019s wife told him not to fly the river because it was getting too dark.&#x0D;\nAbout 2005, the airplane departed FET, and about 2008, one of the passengers texted a friend who lived on the river that they were flying up the river. About 2010, the other passenger sent a Snapchat to his son, and about minute later, the accident occurred.&#x0D;\nA witness recalled that motion caught her eye, and she turned her head in time to see an airplane flying low and to the west up the river. She observed the airplane collide with the high-tension powerlines over the river. She saw part of the tail of the airplane separate from the plane and fall into the river. The airplane then slowly climbed and at first appeared to be flying away without issue. The airplane then turned and descended suddenly until it crashed into the river with a large splash. Another witness recorded video of the airplane making the turn and descent into the water. The airplane engine could be heard running in the video.",

During the landing roll with a right crosswind, the airplane encountered a wind gust. The airplane veered left of the runway centerline and its nose rotated right. The pilot applied left rudder and full engine power but was unable to regain directional control. The airplane exited the right side of the runway, traversed through a swale, impacted a culvert, and its left wing impacted the ground as it crossed a taxiway. The airplane came to rest in a grassy area adjacent to the taxiway. The airplane\u2019s fuselage and left wing were substantially damaged during the accident sequence. The flight instructor reported that there were no preaccident mechanical malfunctions or failure with the airplane that would have precluded normal operation.",

The pilot sustained minor injuries. The airplane was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 personal flight.&#x0D;\nThe pilot reported that there were no engine anomalies noted during the preflight inspection, engine run-up checks, and subsequent takeoff roll for the local flight. During the airplane\u2019s initial climb, at an altitude of about 50 ft above ground level, the airplane experienced a total loss of engine power. With no remaining runway, the pilot elected to perform a forced landing to a field off the departure end of the runway. During the landing, the pilot banked the airplane to the right to avoid the runway approach lights, which resulted in an aerodynamic stall and subsequent impact with terrain. The airplane came to rest in an upright position about 730 ft northeast of the runway. &#x0D;\nThe airplane\u2019s fuselage and wings sustained substantial damage. The airplane was recovered and retained for further examination.",

    "analysisNarrative": "Southwest Airlines flight 3006, a scheduled international passenger flight from William P. Hobby Airport (HOU), Houston, Texas, to Los Cabos International Airport (SJD), San Jose del Cabo, Mexico, experienced a right engine failure resulting in an air turnback. During the turnback, a burning odor was reported in the cabin and an evacuation was commanded after landing. During the evacuation, one flight attendant (FA) sustained a serious injury. &#x0D;\nAccording to the flight crew, they were on day two, leg two, of a three-day line experience rotation. The first officer (FO), pilot flying, was returning from leave and the captain (CA) was a line check airman for the company. During the preflight, the flight crew discussed the automatic terminal information service (ATIS) reporting windshear and planned for a precautionary takeoff profile. The flight crew briefed the engine out procedures and the takeoff profile for runway 22. The taxi and takeoff were normal. &#x0D;\nDuring climb out, the flight crew observed the right engine exhaust gas temperature (EGT) indication momentarily increase into the red overtemp range, then decrease. The flight crew then heard a \u201cpopping\u201d noise and observed the right engine N1 indication decrease to approximately 50%. The CA declared an emergency with air traffic control (ATC) and initiated the Engine Fire, Severe Damage or Separation quick reference checklist (QRC) and the quick reference handbook (QRH) procedures. The FO continued as the pilot flying and coordinated vectors for a return to HOU.&#x0D;\nThe \u201cA\u201d FA contacted the cockpit to inform them of a burning odor in the cabin. The CA informed the FAs that they had an engine malfunction and were returning to HOU. The CA then made a public announcement informing the passengers that they would be landing in 20 minutes. &#x0D;\nAfter completing all appropriate checklists, the CA assumed control of the aircraft, and the FO transitioned to the pilot monitoring. The approach and landing were uneventful. ATC requested that the flight crew exit the runway at the end and coordinate with airport rescue firefighting (ARFF). After clearing the runway and stopping, the CA contacted the FA\u2019s and was informed that there was still a strong burning odor in the cabin. At that time, the CA elected to initiate an evacuation of the airplane. The CA informed ARFF of the decision and the FO began the QRH for an evacuation. The flight crew completed the QRH procedure, including left engine shutdown and FLAP 40 extension, and the CA commanded an evacuation via the left side of the aircraft.&#x0D;\nThe FO evacuated the aircraft to assist with the evacuation while the CA remained onboard until all passengers had evacuated. The CA observed passengers re-entering the aircraft from the overwing exits and then utilizing the door slides. After all passengers and flight attendants had evacuated the aircraft, the CA conducted a final walkthrough and evacuated the aircraft. On the ground, the CA learned that ARFF personnel had directed passengers back into the aircraft due to concerns of injuries sliding off the wing.&#x0D;\nAccording to the \u201cB\u201d FA, seated in the aft galley, during takeoff there was a loud noise and followed by a burning odor. As the aircraft continued to climb the odor intensity decreased and they inspected the area and were unable to identify a source. The B FA contacted the A FA and informed them of the odor. The CA made an announcement that they had experienced an engine failure, and they would be landing in approximately 20 minutes. After landing and stopping, the CA called the FAs and asked if the odor still existed, to which the B FA replied that they still smelled a burning odor. &#x0D;\nAfter the evacuation, the B FA reported an injury to their ankle. They were diagnosed with a hairline fracture.",

    "prelimNarrative": "On April 15, 2025, about 2140, Atlantic daylight time (ADT), Frontier Airlines, flight 3506, an Airbus A321-271NX, N607FR, sustained nose wheel and engine damage during an attempted landing at the Luis Munoz Marin International Airport (SJU), San Juan, Puerto Rico. The 235 passengers and crew onboard were uninjured. The flight was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 121 scheduled domestic passenger flight from Orlando International Airport (MCO), Orlando, Florida to SJU.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the flight crew, the first officer (FO) was the pilot flying, and the captain was the pilot monitoring during the night flight to SJU. The approach was stable but required a slight lateral correction to maintain centerline while descending through about 150 to 100 feet above ground level (agl) on approach to runway 10.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAn aural RETARD alert is designed to occur at a radio altitude (RA) of 20 ft on manual landing to advise the flight crew to reduce the thrust levers to idle. The FO recalled that during the approach, she brought the thrust levers back to idle at 20 ft RA while the RETARD aural alert sounded.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe captain recalled that the landing flare began normally but became high at about 15 ft RA. The FO stated that around 15 ft RA, the captain noted that the aircraft was too high, so she corrected with a shallow descent and then a gradual flare. As the aircraft was about to touch down, the captain called for a go-around.  The captain stated that he believed the aircraft was \u201crunning out of flying speed quickly, as the throttles were retarded and the pitch attitude was increasing\u201d so he assumed control. He recalled that the airplane was slightly nose down with the thrust at the takeoff/go-around (TOGA) setting when the airplane then touched down firmly.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe captain stated that during the go-around, they heard a loud bang coming from under the fuselage and the FO called out that an engine failure was displayed on the electronic centralized aircraft monitor (ECAM) display.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe air traffic control tower (ATCT) controller reported an engine fire, but according to the flight crew, they only had an indication of an engine failure. Unsure of the damage sustained, the captain asked for a foreign object debris (FOD) sweep of the runway and a description of any debris found. Some metal and tire debris were found on the runway and reported to the flight crew.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe captain stated that he flew a low pass by the ATCT to see if the controllers could determine if all three landing gear appeared to be down. The ATCT controller reported that the landing gear was intact, and the flight crew prepared for a visual approach to runway 8. At touchdown, the airplane behaved normally so the captain elected to clear the runway and set the parking brake as the fire department approached to inspect the number one engine for any fire. No fire was present, and the captain elected to coordinate for airstairs to deplane the aircraft rather than using the evacuation slides.  He felt there was no threat to life and the slides posed a greater danger to passengers than the airstairs. He also noted that there were 8 wheelchair passengers on board. The passengers were unloaded via airstairs and bussed to the terminal.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nInvestigation&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn March 16, 2025, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) was notified by Frontier Airlines about the event and, in response, began an incident investigation. As part of the investigative process, the NTSB invited qualified parties to participate in the investigation. These included the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Frontier Airlines, the Air Line Pilots Association, International (ALPA), and Pratt\u00a0&amp; Whitney. In accordance with the provisions of Annex 13 to the Convention on International Civil Aviation, an Accredited Representative from the Bureau d'Enqu\u00eates et d'Analyses (BEA) of France, the State of Design and Manufacture of the airplane, was appointed to support the investigation, with Airbus and EASA as technical advisors.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nNTSB group chairs in the areas of operations, human performance, and flight data recorders were assigned. The flight data recorder (FDR) and the cockpit voice recorder (CVR) were removed from the airplane and shipped to the NTSB\u2019s Vehicle Recorder Laboratory located in Washington, DC, for analysis. A preliminary review of the FDR has been completed and a plot showing several parameters is shown in figure 1. The data revealed that the airplane initially touched down on all three landing gear with a maximum recorded vertical acceleration of about 2.2g. This value is above the hard landing threshold of 1.8g per Frontier Airlines aircraft maintenance manual (AMM) Chapter 5 limitations.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 1. Plot of the FDR data from the event landing.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA post incident inspection of the airplane revealed that the nose landing gear (NLG) left wheel and tire had separated from its axle and departed the aircraft after the initial hard landing (figure 2). One of the wheel halves had fractured and there were numerous scratches and gouges noted on the NLG along with damage to the tow fitting. Metal fragments from the wheel assembly appear to have been ingested by the number one (left) engine and damage was found on the engine's inlet cowl liner, thrust reverser, fan blades, and guide vanes. The left inboard trailing edge flaps were also damaged. None of this damage met the definition of substantial damage or affected the flight control system of the airplane.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn May 5-6, 2025, the operational factors group, with assistance from an NTSB Human Performance Specialist convened in Denver, Colorado. The group interviewed the Frontier airlines flight crew, the Director of Training and the Director of Operations.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n &#x0D;\nFigure 2. Nose landing gear with its left wheel missing (Source: Frontier Airlines)&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nIn January 2021, an article titled \u201cA Focus on the Landing Flare\u201d was published by Airbus in their Safety First magazine. The article analyzes two case studies to highlight operational pitfalls and reinforce best practices during the flare phase of landing. You can read the full article on Airbus\u2019s official\u00a0Safety First\u00a0website here:\u00a0A Focus on the Landing Flare.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe investigation continues.",

The pilot was not injured. The helicopter was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations, Part 91 personal flight. &#x0D;\nThe pilot reported that he had been operating the helicopter for about one hour, practicing takeoff and landings. While about 800 ft above ground level (agl), he felt a shudder and heard the engine sounding differently, followed by the engine chip detector light illuminating and the engine losing power. He entered an autorotation, turned right to an open field, and landed with about a 20-knot tailwind. During the landing sequence, the tail skid contacted the ground initially followed by the tailboom separating near the elevators. &#x0D;\nThe helicopter came to rest balanced on the right skid, right elevator and one main rotor blade. The helicopter sustained substantial damage to the tailboom. A visual examination of the engine revealed damage to the compressor section. The helicopter was recovered to a secure facility for further examination.",

The pilot sustained serious injuries. The airplane was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 personal flight.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot reported that he had departed runway 06 at the Elko Regional Airport, Elko, Nevada. During the initial climb, about 100 ft above ground level, the engine lost total power. He opined that the airplane descended rapidly and collided with a metal trash receptacle. The fuselage structure was substantially damaged. About 5 gallons of light blue colored fuel were drained from the aircraft during the wreckage recovery.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe wreckage was recovered to a secure area for further investigation.",

Upon reaching the airport, and realizing there was still daylight remaining, he elected to perform one more water landing on a nearby river. Approaching the river, he lowered the flaps but neglected to verify the correct position of the landing gear and touched down on water with the landing gear extended. After touchdown the airplane nosed down and came to an abrupt stop resulting in substantial damage to the fuselage. The pilot stated that there was no preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures or of the airplane that would have precluded normal operation.",

The pilot and passenger were not injured. The airplane was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 personal flight.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot reported that, while climbing through 6,300 ft mean sea level (msl), about 20 miles north of Nogales, Arizona, the engine began to sputter. While troubleshooting, he turned on the electric fuel pump and switched fuel tanks. The engine sputtering progressively got worse, and the engine power degraded. Unable to maintain altitude, he elected to make an off-airport landing on a dirt road. During the landing roll, the airplane encountered a wind gust and became airborne. The airplane\u2019s left wing and main landing gear impacted a dirt berm and the airplane came to rest upright. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPostaccident examination of the airplane revealed that the left wing was substantially damaged.

The pilot and two passengers were uninjured, and one passenger sustained minor injuries. The airplane was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 personal flight. &#x0D;\nThe pilot reported that he had departed Henderson Executive Airport, Las Vegas, Nevada (HND) for a personal scenic flight around the Las Vegas area about 0830.  The pilot climbed to 3,500 ft mean sea level (msl) and configured the airplane for cruise flight with 2,300 rpm and 23 inches of manifold pressure until they were about 3 miles southwest of HND. The pilot then increased the engine and propeller settings to 2500 rpm and 25 inches of manifold pressure to climb to 4,500 ft msl. The pilot reported that the airplane would not climb, slowly lost airspeed, and eventually it would not maintain altitude. The pilot elected to initiate an emergency landing on a road adjacent to Interstate 15. During the landing, the pilot noticed oncoming vehicular traffic and maneuvered the airplane into a ditch, which resulted in substantial damage to the fuselage and both wings.&#x0D;\nThe airplane and engine were recovered to a secure location for further examination.",

    "prelimNarrative": "On April 12, 2025, about 1203 eastern daylight time, a Mitsubishi MU-2B-40, N635TA, was destroyed when it was involved in an accident near Copake, New York. The pilot and five passengers were fatally injured. The airplane was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 personal flight.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA review of preliminary ADS-B data and archived voice communication information provided by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) showed that the airplane departed Westchester County Airport (HPN), White Plains, New York, about 1134, and flew on a northeast to northern track towards their planned destination of Columbia County Airport (1B1), Hudson, New York. The data showed that the airplane reached a maximum cruise altitude of about 16,000 ft mean sea level (msl). &#x0D;\n &#x0D;\nAt 1148:48, the Boston Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC) controller cleared the pilot to descend to 6,000 ft msl. The pilot acknowledged and advised the controller that he had the weather for 1B1 and requested the RNAV (GPS) approach to runway 3. The controller advised the pilot to cross PUCBY (initial approach fix), at or above 4,000 ft msl and cleared him for the approach. At 1157:52, the pilot advised the controller that he was on a missed approach and when queried by the controller about his intentions, he responded that he would take vectors for another approach. The controller instructed the pilot to climb and maintain 4,000 ft msl. At 1159:08, the pilot was instructed by the controller to turn right to a heading of 100\u00b0. About 1 minute later, the controller instructed the pilot to continue the right turn to a heading of 140\u00b0 and expect direct PUCBY in about five miles, to which the pilot acknowledged. At 1202:40, the controller instructed the pilot to cross PUCBY at 4,000 ft msl and cleared him for the RNAV (GPS) Runway 3 approach at 1B1, which the pilot acknowledged.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAbout 1 minute later, the controller advised the pilot of a low altitude alert, and to check his altitude immediately, with no response from the pilot. Despite the controller\u2019s multiple attempts, no further radio transmissions were received from the pilot. About 1203:55, the controller advised the pilot that radar contact was lost. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nADS-B data showed the airplane was about 2,450 ft msl and a groundspeed of about 107 knots when the missed approach was initiated. The airplane continued on a northerly heading for several seconds while the groundspeed had decreased to about 91 knots. The data then showed that the airplane began a right climbing turn, and throughout the turn, the groundspeed increased, to a maximum of about 144 knots. The airplane leveled off at an altitude of about 3,800 ft msl and a groundspeed of about 139 knots. Throughout the following 2 1/2 minutes, the airplane maintained an altitude between about 3,800 ft and 3,975 ft msl with a groundspeed fluctuating between about 139-189 knots. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt 1202:22, the airplane began a right turn to the southwest. About 34 seconds later, the airplane began a descent. The last data point showed the airplane at 2,150 ft msl, with a groundspeed of 118 knots (see figure 1).&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 1: Final 2 minutes of ADS-B data.&#x0D;\nRecorded security camera video showed there was a low overcast cloud layer present at the time of the accident. The airplane was observed in the video descending from the cloud layer in a steep descent until it impacted terrain. The sound of the engines could be heard throughout the recording.  &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe National Weather Service did not have any significant meteorological&#x0D;\nadvisories (SIGMETs) or convective SIGMETS or center weather advisories (CWA)&#x0D;\ncurrent over the region surrounding the accident site. The National Weather Service did have several AIRMETs current for IFR and mountain obscuration conditions, low-level wind shear (LLWS) and occasional moderate icing conditions from about 1,500 ft to 17,000 ft msl over the region.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the accident site revealed that the airplane impacted snow covered terrain on a magnetic heading of about 290\u00b0 in a nose down attitude about 500 ft north from the last ADS-B target. Fragments of the airplane were scattered throughout a radius of about 150 ft surrounding the main wreckage. All major components of the airplane were contained within the wreckage debris area. The fuselage was mostly fragmented and separated into multiple sections. The vertical stabilizer, rudder, horizontal stabilizers and elevators, were partially attached to the empennage. The empennage remained partially attached to the fuselage. Both wings were attached to the fuselage and were buckled throughout their span. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe wreckage was recovered to a secure facility for further examination.",

    "prelimNarrative": "On April 11, 2025, about 1906 central daylight time (CDT), an experimental amateur-built Azalea Aviation LLC Saberwing, N121DF, was destroyed when it was involved in an accident near Justin, Texas. The pilot was fatally injured. The airplane was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 personal flight.&#x0D;\nAccording to the airframe kit manufacturer, the pilot was returning to Propwash Airport (16X), Justin, Texas. He departed the Valdosta Regional Airport (VLD) Valdosta, Georgia about 1120 eastern daylight time, with a stop at the Ralph C. Weiser Field Airport (AGO) Magnolia, Arkansas. ADS-B data showed that the airplane arrived at AGO about 1621 CDT. About that time, the manufacturer received a text from the pilot who informed him that he arrived at AGO, needed fuel, all was running well, and that he would try to make it home today. &#x0D;\nPreliminary ADS-B data showed the airplane depart AGO about 1705 CDT and ascended to 4,300 ft mean sea level (msl) on a westerly heading toward 16X. About 1900 CDT the flight track data showed the airplane descended from 2,275 ft to about 1,250 ft and made a series of maneuvers and altitude changes that were consistent with entering the airport traffic pattern. A witness, located at the airport, described seeing the airplane while it was on the downwind leg for runway 35 at a low altitude when it made the base leg turn. &#x0D;\nWitnesses located in a housing community about 0.6 miles south of the airport saw the airplane heading south, turn left, when the left wing dropped, and the airplane turned upside down. One witness saw the airplane spin about one and a half revolutions before it descended out of their sight behind a house. No witnesses reported seeing the airplane impact the terrain. &#x0D;\nThe airplane came to rest upright in an open field, about .5 miles southwest of the threshold for runway 35, on a heading of 200\u00b0 magnetic, and an elevation of about 762 ft msl. The first point of impact was directly underneath the engine which was embedded in the soil about ten inches. A postaccident fire consumed most of the airframe. All major components of the airplane remained adjacent to the fuselage except for the upper structure of the left wing and portions of the fractured canopy, which were located near the main wreckage. A small debris area extended about 30 ft around the wreckage. &#x0D;\nThe wreckage was recovered to a secure facility for further examination.",

The pilot, pilot-rated passenger and passenger were fatally injured. The airplane was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 personal flight. &#x0D;\nPreliminary ADS-B data showed that the airplane departed Lovell Field Airport (CHA), Chattanooga, Tennessee, about 1345, with an intended destination of Burlington/ Alamance Regional Airport (BUY), Burlington, North Carolina. Shortly after departure, the airplane turned to the northeast towards Ocoee-Cherokee National Forest. About 13 minutes after departure, radar contact was lost, and an alert notice (ALNOT) was issued about 3 minutes later (see figure 1). The wreckage was located by local fire and rescue about 2 hours the ALNOT was issued. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 1: Preliminary ADS-B data plotted on Google Earth overlay&#x0D;\nWitnesses at Chilhowee Glider Port (9A2), Benton, Tennessee, which is located about five nautical miles southwest of the accident site, reported that they encountered strong, gusting\u00a0winds about one hour prior to the accident. They stated that they were compelled to park multiple aircraft and observed debris and garbage blowing across their runway. Additionally, they stated that a \u201cweather cell\u201d with precipitation was observed in the general vicinity of the accident site about the time of the accident. &#x0D;\nThe airplane impacted heavily wooded terrain about 38 nautical miles northeast of CHA, at an elevation of about 1,760 ft msl. The first point of contact was identified by broken pine limbs and tree strikes. The wreckage came to rest on sloped terrain, in between white pine trees. The engine, propeller, both wings, fuselage, and empennage were found within the main wreckage which spanned about 60 ft by 30 ft. &#x0D;\nThe fuselage and cockpit area were fragmented. The left wing was separated at the wing root and came to rest about five ft from the fuselage. The right wing came to rest against a tree above the engine and propeller, which were embedded within terrain. Both elevators were separated from the horizontal stabilizers and located within about 400 ft of the main wreckage. The left elevator was torn into 2 pieces, and the right was torn into 3 pieces. &#x0D;\nThe wreckage was recovered to a secure facility for further examination.",

    "prelimNarrative": "On April 11, 2025, at 1023 eastern daylight time, a Cessna 310R, N8930N, was destroyed when it was involved in an accident near Boca Raton, Florida. The two pilots and the passenger were fatally injured, and one person on the ground sustained minor injuries. The airplane was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 personal flight.&#x0D;\nThe accident flight was the first flight after the airplane\u2019s annual inspection had been completed. The airplane departed from the Boca Raton Airport (BCT), Boca Raton, Florida, and was destined for the Tallahassee International Airport (TLH), Tallahassee, Florida. A portion of the airplane\u2019s taxi and departure were captured by airport surveillance video. The video of the taxi revealed that the airplane made several left and right turns as it transitioned to the runup area and runway. The video of the airplane\u2019s takeoff revealed that the airplane maintained the centerline of the runway during the takeoff roll. Shortly after rotation, the airplane yawed to the left and continued in a left turn until the airplane went out of view. The airplane then momentarily reentered the camera frame, as it continued in a left yaw and left turn. &#x0D;\nSeveral witnesses captured videos of the airplane while in flight. The videos depicted the airplane in a left yaw at a low altitude. Audio from the videos were consistent with both engines operating.&#x0D;\nPreliminary ADS-B data revealed that immediately after takeoff, at 1012, the airplane drifted to the left, followed by a left 180\u00b0 turn, followed by a left 360\u00b0 turn. The airplane continued making several left 360\u00b0 turns; the last data point was on the airplane\u2019s 9th turn at 1022 and was 273 ft south of the initial impact point. According to preliminary air traffic control recordings, one of the pilots reported that they were having a problem with the airplane\u2019s rudder and that they could only make left turns. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 1. Preliminary ADS-B Flight Track with initial impact point marked.&#x0D;\nThe airplane\u2019s initial impact point was identified to be several trees in the median of a road. The airplane then impacted the road, and the wreckage path continued until the main wreckage site, which was on a set of railroad tracks, about 370 ft from the initial impact point. The furthest piece of wreckage was identified as the left engine and was found 320 ft past the main wreckage location. The wreckage was highly fragmented, and there was a postimpact fire. The fuselage, including the cockpit, sustained significant thermal damage from the postimpact fire, and most of the fuselage and cockpit had been consumed. All the major components of the airplane were located at the accident site.&#x0D;\nThe airplane\u2019s rudder was found near the initial impact point and exhibited impact and thermal damage. The rudder trim tab remained attached to the rudder and displayed minor impact damage. Flight control cable continuity for the right rudder was confirmed and was continuous from the rudder pedal attach point to the rudder bellcrank attach bracket; however, the rudder bellcrank attach bracket had separated from the rest of the bellcrank. There were no visible signs of fretting between the rudder cable attach bracket and the rudder bellcrank. The left rudder cable was fractured near the rudder pedal attach point and at the rudder bellcrank. The separated cable ends exhibited a splayed, broomstrawed appearance, consistent with tension overload separation. Both cables were attached to their correct installation locations. The rudder trim actuator remained attached to the vertical stabilizer, and the rudder trim chain remained attached to the actuator\u2019s sprocket. The rudder trim rod end extension was measured to be 1.5\u201d, which corresponded to 21\u00b0 trim tab trailing edge right (left rudder). Both rudder trim cables were fractured in the cockpit consistent with tension overload. &#x0D;\nFlight control continuity for the elevator was established and the elevator control cables were continuous and remained attached to the fuselage elevator sector and the elevator bellcrank. The push/pull rod for the elevator bellcrank to the elevator was impact damaged and fractured, and the push/pull rod for the control column to the elevator sector was impact separated near the elevator sector. The elevator trim actuator displayed impact damage, and the elevator trim chain was detached from the actuator's sprocket. The elevator trim was measured to have a length of 2.0\u201d, which corresponded to 11\u00b0 trim tab trailing edge up (elevator down). &#x0D;\nFlight control cable continuity was established for the right aileron from the wing bellcrank to the cockpit controls through breaks that were consistent with tension overload or recovery cuts. Flight control continuity for the left aileron was confirmed through breaks that were consistent with tension overload or recovery cuts. The aileron control cable chains remained attached to the control column and control wheel sprockets. The aileron trim actuator remained attached to its installation point and displayed impact damage signatures. The aileron trim chain remained attached to the aileron trim actuator sprocket and both aileron trim cables were separated and displayed tension overload signatures. The aileron trim actuator was measured to have an extension length of 1.9\u201d, which corresponded to 13\u00b0 trim tab trailing edge up (right roll).&#x0D;\nBoth engines separated from their installation points and displayed impact damage signatures. The left engine\u2019s No.1 cylinder head had broken free from the cylinder barrel and the crankcase was impact-damaged near the bottom forward portion of the crankcase. The crankshaft could only be rotated a few degrees, and continuity was established between the crankshaft and the camshaft. The right engine\u2019s crankshaft was unable to be rotated which was consistent with the observed impact damage. The Nos. 1- and 5-cylinder heads had broken free from their respective cylinder barrels and were found along the wreckage path. The crankcase had significant impact damage to the forward bottom section of the case, and the forward camshaft gear was visible through the broken crankcase and had partially fractured. The intact cylinders were inspected utilizing a lighted borescope, and the piston faces, cylinder walls, and valve heads displayed normal operating and combustion signatures.&#x0D;\nThe left propeller had separated from the crankshaft propeller flange and was found along the wreckage path. All three propeller blades remained within the propeller hub and displayed impact damage. One propeller blade displayed torsional deformation, leading edge polishing and there were several gouges in the trailing edge. A second propeller blade displayed aft, tip curling, polishing of the cambered side, and gouges in the trailing edge. The third propeller blade displayed aft bending deformation, torsional deformation, and S-bending deformation. The right propeller had separated from the crankshaft propeller flange and was found along the wreckage path. One of the propeller blades had separated from the propeller hub and was found along the wreckage path. The separated propeller blade displayed S-bending deformation and leading edge polishing. The second propeller blade displayed aft bending deformation, tip curling, and S-bending deformation. The third propeller blade displayed S-bending deformation and leading edge polishing.&#x0D;\nThe wreckage was retained for further examination.",

While doing so, he relaxed left aileron input, and the left wing began to rise, and the crosswind pushed the airplane to the right. The pilot stated that at this point the airplane was unrecoverable and the airplane ground looped.  During the ground loop, the left main landing gear separated, and the left wing and fuselage struck the ground which resulted in substantial damage to both. At the time of the accident, the pilot was landing on runway 21 with wind from 170\u00b0 at 11 knots.&#x0D;\nIn a subsequent statement the pilot reported that the initial ground loop occurred because of a loss of aircraft control, but that the failure of the gear leg may have been due to a pre-existing corrosion he observed in the leg after the accident. However, during the removal of the airplane from the accident site the gear leg fracture surface was ground down, and the gear leg welded temporarily back into place. Therefore, a determination of the leg condition before the accident could not be made.",

The pilot made multiple attempts to extend the gear and verify a down-and-locked indication without success. After executing the emergency gear extension checklist, the pilot made a low pass at the airport, and personnel on the ground advised over the common traffic advisory frequency that the landing gear appeared to be extended. The pilot prepared for a landing based on this information despite the continued unsafe gear warning annunciation. During the landing, the touchdown was normal, and the airplane slowed normally. After taxiing clear of the runway, the pilot stopped the airplane to complete post-landing checklist items when the left MLG collapsed. The pilot and passenger were not injured. The airplane sustained substantial damage to the left wing.&#x0D;\nPostaccident examination of the left MLG revealed that the left MLG down lock hook was not properly engaged during the landing.",

    "prelimNarrative": "On April 10, 2025, about 1515 eastern daylight time, a Bell 206L-4 helicopter, N216MH, was destroyed when it was involved in an accident near Jersey City, New Jersey. The pilot and five passengers were fatally injured. The helicopter was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 air tour flight.&#x0D;\nPreliminary Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) flight track data obtained from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) revealed the helicopter departed Downtown Manhattan/Wall Street Heliport (JRB), New York, New York, about 1458. The helicopter flew a teardrop pattern south of the Statue of Liberty, then proceeded north along the east side of the Hudson River adjacent to Manhattan, past the George Washington Bridge, where it performed a u-turn, then headed south along the New Jersey side of the river (figure. 1).&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 1. ADS-B flight track overview of entire route of flight from takeoff through loss of signal near the accident location. &#x0D;\nFigure 2 depicts the plot of the helicopter\u2019s ADS-B-observed flight path for the final 1 minute of flight, with the reported time, altitude and groundspeed superimposed. As the helicopter approached the Holland Tunnel ventilation towers near Jersey City, New Jersey, it was at a geometric altitude between 625 and 650 ft. The helicopter\u2019s altitude increased to 675 ft msl before it entered a rapid descent. The data ended at 1514:54.5 and the helicopter\u2019s last observed altitude was 125 ft. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 2. ADS-B flight track and geographic data highlighting the last minute of the flight through breakup, uncontrolled decent and loss of signal.&#x0D;\nSeveral witnesses described hearing several loud \u201cbangs\u201d emanating from the helicopter before it broke up and descended into the river. Surveillance video (with accompanying audio) captured the helicopter traveling south before it suddenly separated into three major sections: fuselage (including the engine), main rotor system (including both main rotor blades, transmission and roof-beam structure), and the tail boom (including the tail rotor) (figure 3).&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 3. Enhanced surveillance video with sequential images depicting the helicopter\u2019s flight and breakup.   &#x0D;\nThe fuselage came to rest, inverted, north of the Holland Tunnel ventilation towers where the water depth was about 6 ft. The main rotor and tail boom sections were found north of the fuselage and were submerged to a depth of about 30 ft. Debris was also recovered from the surface of the river and from a rooftop near the Hoboken, New Jersey, transit building.&#x0D;\nThe helicopter was not equipped with any video or data recording devices. Photos of the pilot taken just before the helicopter departed indicated that he was wearing computer-augmented sunglasses, which had video and audio recording capability. The sunglasses were not recovered.&#x0D;\nThe pilot held a commercial pilot certificate with ratings for rotorcraft-helicopter and instrument helicopter. He held a current Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued first-class medical certificate, and as of March 29, 2025, had logged 790.2 total hours of flight experience, of which, 48.6 hours were in the same make and model as the accident helicopter. The pilot worked a 10 days on/10 days off schedule and the accident flight was his first day back after having 10 days off. The accident flight was the eighth tour flight of the day for the accident helicopter, and all of those flights were operated by the pilot.&#x0D;\nInitial review of the helicopter\u2019s maintenance records revealed the most recent inspection was an \u201cevent 2\u201d of a progressive 300-hour inspection and 100-hour inspection conducted on February 27, 2025. At that time, the helicopter airframe accrued 12,975 total hours of operation, and the engine had accrued a total of 23,305 hours of operation. At the time of the accident, the helicopter had been operated about 50 hours since the inspection.  &#x0D;\nDay, visual meteorological conditions prevailed at JRB at the time of the accident. The surface observation taken at 1456 included broken clouds at 7,500 ft above ground level, wind from 150\u00b0 at 10 knots gusting to 18 knots with variable wind between 120\u00b0 and 190\u00b0, and 10 statute miles visibility. A peak wind of 36 knots from 260\u00b0 was recorded at 1423.&#x0D;\nThe wreckage was recovered from the river and retained for further examination.",

The pilot and passenger were not injured. The airplane was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 personal flight.   &#x0D;\nThe pilot had purchased the tailwheel equipped airplane a couple of days before the accident. He had hired a flight instructor while at Montgomery-Gibbs Field Executive Airport (MYF), San Diego, California, and performed several landings prior to departing for the cross-country flight to Florida. The pilot stated that he had planned a fuel stop at Ak-Chin Regional Airport (A39), Maricopa, Arizona. While on final approach to land at A39, he aborted the first landing due to not being properly aligned with the runway. On the second landing, the approach was stable, and he performed a 3-point landing. During the landing roll, the airplane veered to the right, and the right wing contacted the runway surface, while he was correcting with rudder inputs. Subsequently, the airplane veered left, exited the runway, and came to rest upright. &#x0D;\nThe pilot reported that witnesses at the airport stated that the right main landing gear failed after the airplane touched down on the runway. The pilot added that the right main landing gear wheel and axle assembly had separated. Additionally, when he walked the runway, he observed a skid mark from the right tire on the runway prior to where the wheel assembly had separated.&#x0D;\nPostaccident examination of the airplane revealed that the right wing and horizontal stabilizer were substantially damaged.  The airplane was recovered for further examination.",

    "prelimNarrative": "On April 10, 2025, at 0904 central daylight time, an Aeronca 7AC airplane, N83952, was substantially damaged when it was involved in an accident near Cape Fair, Missouri. The pilot received serious injuries, and the passenger was fatally injured. The airplane was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 91 personal flight.&#x0D;\nGPS data downloaded from a Stratus receiver recovered from the airplane wreckage showed that the flight originated from the pilot\u2019s private airstrip at 0842. The airplane departed the grass airstrip and flew around the area in a non-descript path as would be expected during a pleasure flight. The data showed that the airplane approached the area where the accident occurred from the south. It then made a right turn toward the southeast, immediately followed by a left turn to the southwest. During the final portion of the left turn, the airplane started descending, leveled off, and flew down a valley in the terrain. A set of high-voltage powerlines crossed the valley perpendicular to the airplane\u2019s flight path. It was reported that the utility company spliced two damaged wires after the accident, but the wires had not fallen to the ground.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 1. Entire flight path of airplane.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 2. The final portion of the accident flight.&#x0D;\nA witness to the accident was a friend of the pilot and passenger and was working to construct a pond on his property. He reported that he was in an excavator when he saw the airplane fly over. He stated that the airplane then flew off and he thought it had departed the area. A few minutes later he heard it again, and from his peripheral vision, he saw the airplane crash. The airplane came to rest on the witness\u2019s property underneath the powerlines that were struck by the airplane.&#x0D;\nExamination of the airplane at the accident site confirmed continuity of the flight control system from the cockpit controls to each respective control surface. Examination of the engine confirmed crankshaft rotation without difficulty. Cylinder compression, suction, and valve train continuity were verified during rotation. Spark could not be obtained at the spark plugs due to impact damage to the spark plug leads; however, spark was observed for all cylinders on both magnetos when the leads were trimmed at the distributor caps. The carburetor was removed, and fuel was present in the fuel bowl. No sediment was observed in the bowl. No preimpact anomalies were detected during the examination of the engine or the airframe.",

The surface of the lake was \u201cpolished\u201d smooth by wind and there was a 6 knot, 90-degree crosswind. During takeoff, the tail took longer than normal to become airborne, the pilot  was planning to abort the takeoff when the tail began to lift off the ground. He continued the takeoff, but it became apparent to the pilot that the airplane would not get airborne in time. He aborted the takeoff but the airplane had insufficient braking resulting in the airplane sliding off the lake into vegetation along the shore. The airplane sustained substantial damage to the right wing. The pilot reported no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions that would have precluded normal operations.",

    "prelimNarrative": "On April 8, 2025, about 1459 central daylight time, a Cassutt III M airplane, N5RR, was substantially damaged when it was involved in an accident near Haskell, Oklahoma. The pilot was fatally injured. The aircraft was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 personal flight.&#x0D;\nA witness stated that he was standing in front of the accident pilot\u2019s hangar and had observed the pilot complete two or three laps around the airport traffic pattern. On the final lap, he said the pilot flew the length of the runway at about 100 feet above the ground and then saw the airplane pitch nose up steeply off the end of the runway. The airplane climbed until the airplane slowed down, at which point the airplane leveled off and turned through crosswind to the downwind leg of the traffic pattern where it began to pick up speed once again. He stated that the pilot had routinely done this maneuver in the past. The witness stated that while the airplane was on the downwind leg of the traffic pattern, it entered an aileron roll, and while upside down, the nose dipped towards the ground and the airplane began to lose altitude. The airplane continued through the roll, and it looked like the pilot had managed to level the wings of the airplane and was in the process of pulling out of the ensuing shallow dive but didn\u2019t have enough altitude to do so.  The airplane impacted the ground at a shallow angle, bounced and tumbled with components separating from the airplane. According to the witness, it all happened in about 5 seconds and that it occurred very fast. The witness stated that he had never seen the pilot perform any aerobatic type maneuvers in the past. Multiple witnesses stated that the engine was running at full power at the time of the accident and heard no indication of an engine issue.&#x0D;\nThe airplane was examined at the accident site, and all major components of the airplane were present. Control cable continuity was verified, and no flight control anomalies were noted. The engine exhibited impact damage and no anomalies were noted. Wood propeller blade fragments were found on and in the ground at the initial point of impact. The propeller hub remained attached to the propeller mounting flange. The pilot\u2019s cellphone was recovered at the accident site, and a cursory examination of the phone provided flight track data from an application installed on the phone. No phone calls or texts were present at the time of the accident. The phone was retained for further examination.",

The pilot sustained serious injuries. The airplane was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 personal flight.&#x0D;\nAutomatic Dependent Surveillance \u2013 Broadcast (ADS-B) data initially depicted the airplane at 1233:04 about 1.5 miles southwest of the Platteville Municipal Airport (PVB).  The initial altitude was about 1,400 ft mean sea level (msl). The pilot maneuvered in a 3-mile arc, circling east and then north of the airport. The pilot then continued to maneuver in a broad figure-eight pattern extending to 3-1/2 miles north and west of the airport.&#x0D;\nAbout 1247:33, the airplane was positioned about 0.9 mile north-northeast of the airport about 1,380 ft msl. A gap in ADS-B coverage occurred from then until 1249:52 when the airplane was about 2.3 miles south of the airport.  Afterward, no further ADS-B data was recorded. &#x0D;\nThe airplane impacted an open field about one-third mile south of the runway 33 threshold. The airframe sustained damage to the fuselage and both wings. The pilot stated that he did not recall any aspects of the accident sequence.&#x0D;\nAirframe and engine examinations are planned following recovery of the airplane from the accident site.",

About 25 miles from the airport, the pilot obtained automated weather which reported the wind from 340\u00b0 at 18 knots (kts) and gusting to 25 kts. When he rechecked the weather about 5 miles from the airport, the wind had shifted to 010\u00b0 at 18 kts and gusting to 25 kts, so he maneuvered to land on runway 5. A few seconds before touchdown, the pilot perceived that the wind had shifted to favor runway 31. The airplane touched down, bounced, and the pilot applied power for a go-around; however, he lost rudder effectiveness and control of the airplane. Subsequently, the airplane ground looped to the left, the right main landing gear wheel separated, and the right wing contacted the ground resulting in substantial damage to the rear spar. The pilot reported that there were no preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane that would have precluded normal operation.",

During the maneuver, the flight instructor commanded a go-around about 300 to 400 ft above ground level. The student pilot hesitated, he retracted the flaps without adding power, and the flight instructor took the fight controls to complete the go-around. When the flaps were retracted, the airplane\u2019s stall warning horn activated. As the flight instructor attempted to recover from the possible aerodynamic stall situation, the main landing gear settled onto the ground and the left wing impacted a fence post. The left wing became separated from the fuselage, the airplane traveled through a fence, and it came to rest partially upright on a pasture. The flight instructor and student pilot were able to egress from the airplane without further incident. The airplane sustained substantial damage to both wings and the fuselage.&#x0D;\nThe flight instructor reported there were no preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airframe or the engine that would have precluded normal operation. The flight instructor further reported that the accident could have been prevented by an improved briefing with the student on training procedures prior to the flight and utilizing a higher go-around altitude during the maneuver to maintain terrain clearance.",

    "prelimNarrative": "On April 7, 2025, at 0606 Pacific daylight time, a Honda Aircraft Company HA-420, N826E, was substantially damaged when it was involved in an accident in North Bend, Oregon. The pilot and three passengers sustained minor injuries; one passenger sustained serious injuries. The airplane was being operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 corporate flight.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe airplane departed St. George, Utah, at 0409, on an instrument flight rules flight plan. As he approached the airport, the pilot configured the airplane for landing on the ILS Z approach to runway 5. He had flown this particular approach regularly because every Monday morning for the last year, he flew the same flight around the same time, transporting the operator\u2019s employees from St. George, Utah, to North Bend, Oregon, returning each Friday. The front right-seated passenger, the son-in-law of the airplane\u2019s owner, was a student pilot nearing his certification, but he was not flying the airplane. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot detailed his pre-landing procedures, specifically describing how he determined VREF (calculated reference speed for final approach). He stated that he entered relevant data into the airplane\u2019s Flight Management System (FMS) which included the following data blocks ( the information he stated he enter are in parentheses): runway condition (wet), weather information (11\u00b0C), flap settings (full down), runway selection (runway 5), wind information (provided from the airport\u2019s AWOS), and the airplane\u2019s weight (the system calculated by using fuel burn, but he recalled was around 9,000 lbs). The FMS then provided the required landing distance of approximately 4,200 feet, which he thought was well under the runway length. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot recalled that on the day of the accident, the approach was normal and there was a reported crosswind of nine knots. There was limited visibility due to darkness at that time of the morning and he did not specifically observe standing water on the runway but the pilot was aware of recent heavy rainfall. The airplane crossed the runway threshold around 117-118 knots, slightly above the VREF calculated speed of 113 knots, which he configured due to the crosswind. The airplane touched down on the runway surface at approximately 1,000 feet from the approach end near 113 knots, consistent with his typical procedures.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot further stated that the initial braking felt normal, and he anticipated the airplane's deceleration rate would enable him to exit the runway at taxiway Bravo. As the airplane continued the landing roll and was about halfway down the runway, the braking was seemingly ineffective, though there were no warnings or messages. The pilot and right-seated passenger then applied maximum brake pressure, but the airplane was not responding. Recognizing the inability to stop, and as the landing roll continued toward the localizer antenna at the end of the runway, the pilot maneuvered the airplane to the right to avoid the structure. The airplane traversed through grass and mud before descending an approximate 15-foot embankment into adjacent water. The occupants exited the airplane through the main door into the shallow salt water. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA review of the ADS-B data showed that at 0606:14, the airplane touched down on the runway near the aiming point markings. The airplane continued down the centerline, decelerating from a ground speed of about 128 knots to 125 knots, which was the last recorded hit (near taxiway Bravo). A visual examination of the runway surface revealed no evidence of skid marks or indications of the anti-skid braking system operating. Light tire tracks were observed on the overrun area and through the grass with no indication of braking. The left tire track was about 23ft from the end of the localizer antenna structure; the distance from the left winglet to the left tire is about 15ft (see figure 1).  &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 1: ADS-B track and landing roll in reference to the localizer antenna.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nLocated on the north side of the airport, runway 5 is oriented northeast-southwest and is 5,980 ft long by 150 ft wide (see figure 2). The runway is constructed of grooved asphalt/concrete and has a listed Landing Distance Available (LDA) of 5,320ft, which excludes the 660 ft length of the displaced threshold for runway 23. The overrun area is about 340 ft, followed by about 100 ft of grass and rocks between the end of the pavement and the water.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 2: Runway 5 in reference to the accident site.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe airplane had been upgraded with the Honda Aircraft Company Airplane Flight Manual (AFM) Supplement, \"Wet and Contaminated Runway Performance\" for the HondaJet ELITE S (Revision A, dated July 20, 2023). The logbooks indicated the software had been upgraded in the FMS to reflect the revised AFM. The definition contained in the supplement for \u201cwet runway\u201d is then \u201cwater depth on the runway is less than 0.125 inch.\u201d&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe VREF and landing distance required were calculated from the AFMS based on the temperature of 11\u00b0C, the self-reported weight of 9,000 lbs, a \u201cwet\u201d runway, negligible tail/head wind, a runway slope gradient of 0.05%, and an airport altitude of 16 ft. The AFMS provided a required landing distance of 5,910 ft, and a VREF of 111kts.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe airplane was not equipped with thrust reversers or spoilers. During landing, the speed brake was deployed; the emergency braking system was not used. The initial examination of the wheels and braking system revealed no evidence of failures, excessive wear, or malfunctions. Investigators removed components from the airframe to be tested at a later date.  &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA preliminary comparison of prior flights and the accident flight was performed (see figure 3). The accident flight was similar to the previous flights, aside from a slightly higher ground speed at touchdown. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 3: Comparison of the accident approach to the airplane\u2019s five prior approaches to that runway.",

    "prelimNarrative": "On April 6, 2025, about 1020 eastern daylight time, a Hiller UH-12E, N48263, was substantially damaged when it was involved in an accident near Rockledge, Florida. The private pilot and passenger sustained serious injuries. The helicopter was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 personal flight.&#x0D;\nAccording to Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) ADS-B data and pilot information, the pilot made a left turn and proceeded in a southwest direction climbing to 600 ft barometric altitude. The helicopter remained on that heading, flying between 68 and 70 knots indicated airspeed until about 1019:48, when the pilot stated that he felt deceleration and the helicopter turned to the right and began flying in a northerly direction. The pilot stated that he had no recollection of anything that occurred after the right turn, but witness video depicted the helicopter yawing left and right about the vertical axis while descending vertically. Before the helicopter went out of view behind trees, the helicopter was yawing slightly to the left. During the video, sound from the rotor(s) and engine could be heard.&#x0D;\nThe helicopter impacted on the infield of a baseball field and came to rest on its right side. Fuel leakage was noted at the sight. The helicopter was recovered and retained for further examination.",

After performing a go-around during the initial landing attempt, the flight instructor described that the student configured the airplane for landing and verified that the landing gear were extended. About 2 seconds after the airplane touched down on the runway normally, the nose landing gear collapsed. The airplane came to rest on the runway and the lower forward fuselage was substantially damaged. Postaccident examination of the landing gear revealed that the lower bolt, which secured the nose landing gear down lock link to the lower drag link, was missing. The bolt was not found after the accident. Without this bolt, the nose landing gear could not remain in a locked position after it was extended. Given this information, it is likely that the bolt separated during the flight, which resulted in the nose landing gear collapse during the subsequent landing.",

    "prelimNarrative": "On April 3, 2025, about 1222 eastern daylight time, a Cessna 182P, N1910M, was substantially damaged when it was involved in an accident near Sanford, Florida. The commercial pilot received minor injuries. The airplane was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 personal flight.&#x0D;\nAccording to the pilot, while holding after several unsuccessful attempts to land at Lakeland Linder International Airport (LAL), Lakeland, Florida, he became disoriented and uncertain of his location. The pilot radioed an air traffic controller and requested assistance. The pilot stated that he was advised to switch frequencies and shortly thereafter, he was asked to \u201cIdent,\u201d but the controller could not locate the pilot\u2019s position. The pilot was then advised to squawk 7700 on his transponder. The pilot became concerned about the airplane\u2019s remaining fuel quantity, noticed an airport to his left side, later determined to be Orlando Sanford International Airport (SFB), Orlando, Florida, and elected to land. The pilot attempted a landing on runway 36, where the airplane bounced, and the pilot performed a go-around. The pilot then circled the airport at a low altitude before attempting a landing on runway 9L. During the second landing attempt, the pilot stated that a gust of wind caused the airplane to drop \u201chard\u201d on the nose, subsequently, the nose gear collapsed. &#x0D;\nWitnesses at SFB reported observing the airplane flying low and \u201cuncoordinated\u201d over the airport. Surveillance video showed the airplane approaching from the west side of runway 36 at about a 45\u00b0 angle past the threshold before the airplane bounced and then began a go-around. An additional video showed the airplane flying low and perpendicular to runway 9L at tree top height before making a left banking turn and contacting the runway in a nose down attitude. &#x0D;\nThe airplane sustained substantial damage to the lower fuselage and engine mounts.&#x0D;\nThe wreckage was retained for further examination.",

    "prelimNarrative": "On April 2, 2025, at 2030 central daylight time, a Cessna 210L airplane, N1574P, was destroyed when it was involved in an accident near Raceland, Louisiana. The pilot and flight instructor were fatally injured. The airplane was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 91 instructional flight.&#x0D;\nSouthern Seaplane, Inc., the airplane owner/operator, informed investigators that the accident pilot had recently reached 500 hours of total flight experience, and that the purpose of the accident flight was to provide the pilot the opportunity to gain more night flight experience and to conduct an instrument proficiency check of the pilot by the instructor that was on-board the airplane. The operator indicated that they intended to add the accident pilot to their on-demand air charter certificate sometime in the future and were helping her gain the experience necessary. &#x0D;\nThe operator said the intended route of flight was to originate from the Southern Seaplane Airport (65LA), Belle Chase, Louisiana, fly to the Houme-Terrebonne Airport (HUM), Houma, Louisiana, perform an instrument approach, fly to the South Lafourche Leonard Miller Jr. Airport (GAO), Galliano, Louisiana, perform another instrument approach, and then return to 65LA.&#x0D;\nPreliminary flight track data indicated that the airplane departed 65LA about 2000 and proceeded toward the west. The flight contacted the New Orleans Approach control facility and requested to fly a practice ILS (instrument landing system) approach into HUM. The flight later requested an instrument flight rules clearance since they would need to penetrate the clouds during the flight. A clearance was issued and the controller provided vectors for the ILS runway 18 approach to HUM. During the flight, the flight crew requested a climb to 3,000 ft msl to attempt to get out of turbulence, which was granted by the controller. The controller continued issuing vectors for the Runway 18 ILS approach to HUM and ultimately cleared the flight for the approach. The flight acknowledged the approach clearance, and the controller authorized a frequency change to the HUM advisory frequency. No further communications were recorded from the accident airplane.&#x0D;\nThe reported weather conditions at HUM about the time of the accident included wind from 140\u00b0 at 19 knots, gusting to 26 knots, 7 statute miles visibility, overcast ceiling at 1,400 ft. temperature 26\u00b0 C, dew point 23\u00b0C, altimeter setting 29.89 in-Hg.&#x0D;\nThe airplane impacted a marsh about 7.5 nm north of HUM. The only part of the airplane visible above the surface of the marsh was the left wing. The wreckage was confined to a small area and the wreckage signatures were consistent with a near vertical impact.&#x0D;\nThe airplane wreckage was recovered from the marsh and a layout examination performed. Several components of the airplane and engine were not located during recovery from the accident scene; however, examination confirmed the presence of all primary aircraft structures and flight control surfaces. The airplane\u2019s engine and all three propeller blades were also recovered from the accident scene. The airplane\u2019s instrument panel and firewall were not found during the recovery.",

    "analysisNarrative": "The pilot of the glider took off under aerotow for a flight in the local soaring area. The pilot released from the tow airplane at an altitude of 2,500 ft and 3 miles downwind of the airport. While soaring, the pilot found a thermal and regained some lost altitude to 2,300 feet msl. The pilot then reported making several 360\u00b0 turns in the thermal to gain additional altitude, but he then noticed that he was now 8 miles from the airport and decided to turn back toward the airport. While soaring back to the airport, the pilot was unable to find any thermals to regain altitude. When the pilot was 3 miles from the airport at an altitude of 1,000 ft, he determined he did not have sufficient altitude to make it back to the airport and began to look for an off-airport landing area. The pilot found a pasture that he believed would be a suitable landing site. During the approach, the pilot noticed there was a wire fence across the pasture. As he approached the fence during landing, he retracted the spoilers and pitched the nose up in an attempt to clear the fence. Subsequently, the stall warning activated, and the glider impacted a fence pole which resulted in substantial damage to both wings. The pilot reported there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the glider that would have precluded normal operation. He further stated that the accident could have been prevented if he had requested that he be towed and released upwind of the airport.",

    "prelimNarrative": "On April 1, 2025, about 1704 eastern daylight time, a Cessna 310Q, N8242Q, was substantially damaged when it was involved in an accident near Midvale, Ohio. The pilot was fatally injured. The airplane was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 personal flight. &#x0D;\nThe pilot\u2019s family members stated that he had been practicing \u201c360\u00b0 maneuvers.\u201d Preliminary Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) data showed that the airplane departed about 1640 from Harry Clever Field Airport (PHD), New Philadelphia, Ohio, and made a series of 360\u00b0 turns southeast of the airport (see figure. 1). &#x0D;\nTwo pilots performing an instructional flight in the airport\u2019s traffic pattern reported that the pilot of N8242Q announced over the Common Traffic Advisory Frequency (CTAF), that he was on a 5-mile final approach leg of the traffic pattern for runway 33. When the airplane was on about a 2-mile final approach, the pilot announced that he was breaking off the approach to the east. The instructional flight flew an extended left downwind leg of the traffic pattern to allow time for N8242Q to reenter the final approach leg, then reentered the downwind leg. Shortly after, the pilot of N8242Q announced that he was performing a \u201c360\u201d to enter the final approach. The pilots observed N8242Q in a nose down attitude spinning toward the ground. They further stated that there were no emergency or distress calls announced over the CTAF prior to the accident.&#x0D;\nA witness located near the accident site reported that he observed a twin engine airplane in a steep bank right turn followed by a spiraling nosedive as it descended to the ground.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 1. ADS-B Flight Track&#x0D;\nThe airplane\u2019s main wreckage was located in a cultivated field about 3.6 miles southeast of PHD. Postaccident examination of the accident site revealed that the airplane impacted the terrain in a nose low attitude and came to rest on a southwest heading. The fuselage and both wings were mostly consumed by a postimpact fire. All major structural components of the airplane were located at the accident site. Flight control continuity was established from the cockpit to all flight control surfaces. The left and right engines remained attached to their engine mounts and exhibited impact and thermal damage. Crankshaft continuity was established to the rear gears of both engines via hand rotation of their attached propellers. Impact damage was noted to the aluminum three-bladed propellers. Leading-edge damage and chord-wise abrasion was noted to the propeller blades, and the propeller spinners exhibited torsional deformation. &#x0D;\nThe wreckage was retained for further examination.",
